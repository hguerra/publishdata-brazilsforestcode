    "part01": "This application aims to assess the trade-offs associated with the implementation of the forest restoration as per Brazilian Forest Code and to project future land use and agricultural production. All scenarios are identical from 2000 to 2020 capturing major land-use trajectories as well as production of major crops and animals. The scenarios are based on the IDCImperfect2 scenario from (",
    "part02": "Soterroni et al., 2018",
    "part03": ") where an imperfect illegal deforestation control takes place in the Amazon and the Cerrado biomes following a probability of Forest Code enforcement. There is no deforestation control in the rest of the country but the Atlantic Forest biome, where deforestation is not allowed from 2006 onwards to reflect more restrictive legislation (Law. 11,428/2006 known as Atlantic Forest Law). Differently from the IDCImperfect2 scenario, here all scenarios consider the Soy Moratorium (SoyM) -- a zero-deforestation agreement for soy produced and sourced from the Brazilian Amazon -- effective after 2005, and climate change shifters for global and local feedbacks applied from 2011 onwards. After 2020, the scenarios are different regarding deforestation control and restoration targets."
